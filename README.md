# Users API - Authentication & Authorization Study Project

<p align="center">
  A NestJS learning project focused on implementing authentication, authorization, and user management features.
</p>

## Description

This repository contains a **study project** built with [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) to learn and practice:

- 🔐 **Authentication** (Login/Register)
- 🛡️ **Authorization** (Role-based access control)
- 👤 **User Management** (CRUD operations)
- 🔑 **JWT Token handling**
- 🔒 **Password hashing and security**
- 🛠️ **Guards, Pipes, and Interceptors**

## Learning Objectives

- Understand JWT authentication flow
- Implement role-based authorization
- Learn NestJS decorators and guards
- Practice TypeScript and NestJS best practices
- Explore database integration with TypeORM/Prisma
- Handle validation and error management

## Features

- 🎯 User registration and login
- 🎯 JWT token generation and validation
- 🎯 Password encryption with bcrypt
- 🎯 Role-based access control (Admin, User)
- 🎯 Protected routes with Guards
- 🎯 Input validation with DTOs
- 🎯 Error handling and custom exceptions

## API Endpoints
